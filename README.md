# Web based Toliss A3XX interaction UI

This is a web application that connects to X Plane's WebSocket server to interact with Toliss' Airbus 319, 320, and 321. This is used to avoid using the mouse in my setup by having all actions reachable "IRL".

## Goals

- [x] ECP
- [x] Landing Gear indicator
- [x] Auto break buttons
- [x] Terrain on ND Capt and FO side 
- [ ] Transponder
- [ ] "Weather panel"

All other panels will be replaced by a physical device, whether Winwing's or Throttletek's.
